#+Title: A volatile temporary directory

Simple python script + systemd timer to manage a volatile temporary
directory (default ~~/volatile-tmp~).  Files in this directory will be
deleted once their last modification time is older than the expiry.
Sub-directories can have different expiry times, or be temporarily
preserved by dropping a file called ~.preserve~ in the top level of
the subdir.

The aim is something more reliable than ~/tmp~ (which disappears on
boot) and more mangeable than just a dir ~~/tmp~.  Plus, if you dont
exclude it from being backed up, the probability of finding a file if
you really need it decays exponentially with your backup-clearing
software ;)

* Install
