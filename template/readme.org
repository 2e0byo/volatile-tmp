#+Title: Volatile temporary files

This directory is special: files in it expire and are deleted after a
period.  The default period is set in [[file:.volatile][.volatile]].  

The algorithm works as follows:

- The age of every file is checked, and any files older than the expiry
  time are deleted.

- The age of every (sub) directory is calculated as that of the
  youngest file in the directory (recursively), and the directory
  processed accordingly.

Diretories may contain a ~.volatile~ in which case it takes
precedence.  Additionally, any directory containing a file called
~.preserve~ will be ignored until that file is removed.
